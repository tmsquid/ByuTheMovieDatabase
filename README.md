How to run:
This application was designed using Netbeans 8.1. The language is written in JAVA, JavaScript and HTML.
Best way to run this application is to install Netbeans 8.1 and open project.

This that I would include in future version:

1) Remove websocket URL out off JavaScript file and put in Config file.

2) Remove API Key out of GetSearchMovie.java file and put in Config file.

3) Movie only page.
    When you click on to a movie in a row, it will open up that movie 'Movie Only Page.
    This 'Movie Only Pager would have a lot more information about the page.
    It may even have trailers that can be clicked on and watched,

4) Add Links to where movie can be watched.
